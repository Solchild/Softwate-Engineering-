Hi, this is a test of this text file.  Thank you! 
Second line for solidarity.
maybe a third.
Unorignial shit incoming::: Good descriptive writing creates an impression in the reader's mind of an event, 
a place, a person, or a thing. The writing will be such that it will set a mood or describe something in 
such detail that if the reader saw it, they would recognize it.

To be good, descriptive writing has to be concrete, evocative and plausible.

sorry about that, I had to test things.  One more for the road!
