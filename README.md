Project 1
Assumptions
-All english can fit every word in the english dictionary (by itself, 1-45 characters) 
-12 characters represented an inch 
-no negative margins
-the text file to read from is TEST1.TXT
  -could easily have it be read in, but didn't want to test

Algorithm
-get the file
-ask user for margins
-put all words in the file into an array
-start at the end of the first margin
-test before every word if the word can fit inbetween the margins
-put words that fit in with their spaces determined by the previous word

Source code
-Project1File.py


Test cases
-TEST1.TXT
-every combination of margins
